Observer-观察者模式

Introduction
    The observer pattern provides a way of ensuring that a set of objects is notified whenever the state of another object changes.

Intent
    To manage a one to many relationship between an object and those objects interested in the state
    and in particular state changes of that object.
    Thus when the objects state changes, the interested (dependent) objects are notified of that change
    and can take whatever action is appropriate.

Forces/Motivation
• Two, otherwise independent types, are related by
   the changes in the state of one (which need to be notified to the other).
• Where a change in the state of one object needs to be notified to zero or
  more other objects and where the number or actual objects may change or are not known until runtime.
