适配器模式

Introduction
An Adapter lets types work together that were not
originally designed for such a purpose either because
their interfaces are not compatible or because their interfaces are not known to each other.

Intent
To convert the interface of one type into the interface that the client expects.

Forces/Motivation
You want to achieve the following:
• To link together to types in which the operations are semantically the same but are not named the same.
• To link together two types in which are functionally the same but where they are not related in the type system.
• To link together two types in which the data formats required are transformable but not directly compatible.
• Some combination of the above.

Constituent Parts

The Adaptee
The Client
